I am concerned about the validity and accuracy of your recent investigation of these accounts that are reporting on my credit report. Last month I requested an investigation because I felt the item was not being reported legally. Couple of days ago I received a letter stating that you have ceased investigation of my credit reports because, in your opinion, you believe that I have used a third party credit repair agency. Not only do I believe this to be a stall tactic on your part to grant you an additional 30 days to comply with my original request, but I believe it to be a blatant violation of the FCRA.

I have attached a copy of my government issued ID as well as mail showing proof of address. So, there shouldnt be any confusion or stall tactics on your end. I have maintained a careful record of my communications with you for the purpose of filing a complaint with the FTC should you continue in your non-compliance.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",GA,31024,,Consent provided,Web,2025-08-18,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,15345647

I am concerned about the validity and accuracy of your recent investigation of these accounts that are reporting on my credit report. Last month I requested an investigation because I felt the item was not being reported legally. Couple of days ago I received a letter stating that you have ceased investigation of my credit reports because, in your opinion, you believe that I have used a third party credit repair agency. Not only do I believe this to be a stall tactic on your part to grant you an additional 30 days to comply with my original request, but I believe it to be a blatant violation of the FCRA. 

I have attached a copy of my government issued ID as well as mail showing proof of address. So, there shouldnt be any confusion or stall tactics on your end. I have maintained a careful record of my communications with you for the purpose of filing a complaint with the FTC should you continue in your non-compliance.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",CA,93313,,Consent provided,Web,2025-08-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,,15170822

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This leads way to civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n, which allows for {$1000.00} per violation, for account listed without my expressed written consent.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",CA,92131,,Consent provided,Web,2025-08-27,Closed with explanation,Yes,,15563934
